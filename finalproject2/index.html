      <article>
        <p> I am an undergraduate student at Bellevue College working toward my Bachelor’s degree in Digital Marketing. I decided to take this course to expand my knowledge in the web creation space and gain hands-on experience in building and designing websites.

Throughout this quarter, I have been able to apply what I’ve learned to real projects, practicing and refining my skills. I would love for you to explore the different projects I’ve immersed myself in and see how my journey as a digital marketer and web creator is evolving.</p>
