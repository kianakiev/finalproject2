      <h3>Lab 1 - Starting a Coding Project</h3>
      <p>This lab introduced basic HTML structure. I learned how to create and draft my first official piece of code to start off the quarter. I was given the chance to use phoneix code editor and my file manager on my computer to craft my first assignment with ease. Here is my example: </p>

      <h3>Project 3 - Favorite City</h3>
      <p>Although it was a trickier assignment then the first lab work done in this class, I was able to learn what works and doesnt work for me. I was also able to play around with adding images and creating a true webpage of my own. What made it even better was I got to talk about one of my own favorite cities and add my own personal touch to it. Here is my example:</p>
      <a class="project-link" href="project3/index.html" target="_blank">Visit Project 3</a>
    </section>

      <h3>Project 4 - Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</h3>
      <p>This project introduced interactive elements such as creating my own style css that matched with the book and images the summarized the storyline of Alice's adventures in wonderland. I was also able to experience using a external web-based platforms to help host and manage my code. Here is my example: </p>
      <a class="project-link" href="project4/index.html" target="_blank">Visit Project 4</a>
